1. Push the specified branch to , along with all of the necessary commits and internal objects.
This creates a local branch in the destination repository. To prevent you from overwriting commits,
Git won’t let you push when it results in a non-fast-forward merge in the destination repository. {
	git push <remote> <branch>
}

2. Same as the above command, but force the push even if
it results in a non-fast-forward merge.
Do not use the --force flag unless you’re absolutely sure you know what you’re doing {
	git push <remote> --force
}


3. Push all of your local branches to the specified remote {
	git push <remote> --all
}

4. Tags are not automatically pushed when you push a branch or use the --all option.
The --tags flag sends all of your local tags to the remote repository {
	git push <remote> --tags
}
