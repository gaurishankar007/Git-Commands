1.Track all the files that are deleted from the local repository and remove them {
	git ls-files --deleted -z | xargs -0 git rm 
	git status
	git commimt -m "deleted files removed"
}


2.To remove a file both from the Git repository and the filesystem,
you can use git rm without any parameters (except for the file's name, of course) {
	git rm file1.txt
}

3.If you only want to remove the file from the repository,
but keep it on the filesystem, you can add the --cached flag {
	git rm file2.txt --cached
}

4.When trying to delete multiple files in a directory
or via a glob pattern, you might want to perform a 
"dry-run" first and see which files would be removed {
	git rm css/* --dry-run
	<=======Output=======>
	rm 'css/about.css'
	rm 'css/general.css'
	<=======Output=======>
}
