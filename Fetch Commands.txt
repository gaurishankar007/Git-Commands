1. Fetch all of the branches from the repository,
   this also downloads all of the required commits and files from the other repository {
	git fetch <remote>
}

2. Same as the above command, but only fetch the specified branch {
	git fetch <remote> <branch>
}

3. A power move which fetches all registered remotes and their branches {
	git fetch --all
}

4. The --dry-run option will perform a demo run of the command, 
   it will output examples of actions it will take during the fetch but not apply them {
	git fetch --dry-run
}
